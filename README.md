# langchain-learning

Notes and beginner langchain projects for me to learn langchain.

## Learning Goal:

The goal for this course is to be able to build AI applications in two domains: AI Agents, and Retrieval Augmented Generation. I would like to gain an understanding of the mechanisms that drive these applications under the hood, which means being adept at Prompt Engineering, and understanding the LangChain Ecosystem stack, like using LangSmith for tracing, and LangGraph for workflow engineering. In addition to all this, I'll cover how to create production ready LangChain apps, with enterprise concerns like testing, logging & monitoring, security, and more.
